## Our version of this game is not implementing _all_ the features of the game but here are some features:

In our version, each player starts with the following things:
* 2D Gameboard
* Food tokens
* eggs
* bird cards
* 8 action cubes

One of the players starts the game and choses one of the following actions
1. Play a Bird 
2. Gain Food
3. Lay eggs (not yet implemented)
4. Draw a Bird (not yet implemented)

The above actions have been described in the code.

After each action, the number of action cubes decrement by 1 and once all the players are left with 0 action cubes, the round is over.
In our version, the player who is left with the most food tokens at the end of each round wins.

The player who wins a round is given a point and at the end the player with maximum points, wins.
